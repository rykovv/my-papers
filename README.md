## [Power Supply Design Techniques for Conventional and Energy Harvesting Power Systems](Power_Supply_Design_Techniques_for_Conventional_and_Energy_Harvesting_Power_Systems.pdf)

Development of electronic systems was always intrinsically related to the power that makes them work.Each electronic system may it be a conventional domestic device, hand-held gadget, or embedded system, has to be provided with a required power supply. The present work discusses important issues related to the power supplies and suitable for the majority of electronic devices.

The document follows two research lines related to conventional and energy harvesting power systems. While conventional power sources are based on fossil fuels burning or even renewable sources as wind, energy harvesting uses small amounts of exclusively clean and inexhaustible energy. Energy sources used in both fields are discussed presenting a concise overview for each source.

Electronic systems require an appropriate input power. To achieve these level of power the input power has to be transformed. Main techniques for power transformation used with AC- or DC-powered systems are presented and explained in detail.

Two significant issues which have to be considered in almost all designs, namely power supply protection and combination of multiple power sources are discussed and crucial points plainly exposed for the reader.

This document can serve as a reference during custom power supply design process.

## [Energy Harvesting Technology Advances and Practical Applications: State of the Art](Energy-Harvesting-Technology-Advances-and-Practical-Applications-State-of-the-Art.pdf)

The humanity gets increasingly concerned about the environmental footprint it leaves on the Earth. Conventional methods of energy generation as fossil fuels are not alone under attention including all types of batteries. This impulses a rapid development of methods for energy extraction from alternative sources. Energy harvesting is a nonstop growing field of research which aims to provide energy for low-power applications with specific power requirements. This paper makes an overview of these technologies and provides current state of the art for each
harvesting technology.

## [Integrated Circuit Design Flow. Overview](Integrated-Circuit-Design-Flow-Overview.pdf)

With the increasing technology advances the integration density of integrated circuits (ICs) still grows proportionally with the Mooreâ€™s law and expected to follow this trend in the near future. Albeit a subject of the IC design remains hidden from the most computer engineers and low-level programmers, it appears to be of high importance for thorough electronic product understanding, especially in cases of specific-purpose product design.

This work aims to uncover all important steps of the IC design and give detailed insights into its crucial phases. It is presented not as a manual, but rather as a theoretical guide which introduces basic as well as advanced concepts pertaining to this process. General design methodology, hierarchy abstractions, and special design considerations are introduced.

## [Software Design Patterns For Device Programming in WSN](Design_Patterns_For_Device_Programming_in_WSN_Vladislav_Rykov.pdf)

Software developers around the world tend to follow the best practices established by the engineering community. Such practices aimed on effectively solving commonly faced problems are called Software Design Patterns.

Since there are many software development areas, i.e. Machine Learning (ML) or Embedded Software, design patterns were polished throughout every area. The area of wireless communication or Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is not an exception. WSN nodes are devices that require low-level programming, and this work discusses design patterns that will help to organize the development.

Hardware access is a common action during WSN node development. There were conceived many hardware access design patterns that improve code portability, multiple module support, and hardware modules interactions. Since WSN nodes often are charged with many tasks, concurrency and resource management patterns were made up for those contexts. Nodes actions, more often than not, are constrained to a certain sequence of states, and state machines govern state transitions. Thus, state machines patterns were brought into light.

Present work focuses on those three types of patterns: hardware access, concurrency and resource management, and state machines. The patterns are considered in the WSN area.

## [Smart City Parking Vehicle Detection System Based on Magnetic Field Sensors](Smart_City_Parking_Vehicle_Detection_System_Based_on_Magnetic_Field_Sensors.pdf)

The developed system constitutes one of many existent sensor solutions for Smart Cities. In the era of optimization and data processing it brings many benefits reducing the time a vehicle looks for a parking place as well as a carbon dioxide produced by the moving vehicles. The final product is delivered to a customer as Platform as a Service (PaaS) infrastructure where recollected data is received and visualized.

## [Design and Implementation of a Complete Internet of Things Infrastructure: Insightful Lightweight Platform with Real-Time Devices Automation and Alerts, Gateway and Device Firmware, and Communication Protocol](Design_and_Implementation_of_a_Complete_Internet_of_Things_Infrastructure.pdf)

This document contains a final master thesis project in which a complete Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure is proposed and developed. The infrastructure consists of a lightweight platform, easily capable to run on a Raspberry Pi board; gateway and communication protocol. The project was developed during the research activity at University Jaume I for the purposes of the research group related to the IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).
