## [Power Supply Design Techniques for Conventional and Energy Harvesting Power Systems](Power_Supply_Design_Techniques_for_Conventional_and_Energy_Harvesting_Power_Systems.pdf) 

Abstract

Development of electronic systems was always intrinsically related to the power that makes them work.Each electronic system may it be a conventional domestic device, hand-held gadget, or embedded system, has to be provided with a required power supply. The present work discusses important issues related to the power supplies and suitable for the majority of electronic devices.

The document follows two research lines related to conventional and energy harvesting power systems. While conventional power sources are based on fossil fuels burning or even renewable sources as wind, energy harvesting uses small amounts of exclusively clean and inexhaustible energy. Energy sources used in both fields are discussed presenting a concise overview for each source.

Electronic systems require an appropriate input power. To achieve these level of power the input power has to be transformed. Main techniques for power transformation used with AC- or DC-powered systems are presented and explained in detail. 

Two significant issues which have to be considered in almost all designs, namely power supply protection and combination of multiple power sources are discussed and crucial points plainly exposed for the reader.

This document can serve as a reference during custom power supply design process.

## [Energy Harvesting Technology Advances and Practical Applications: State of the Art](Energy-Harvesting-Technology-Advances-and-Practical-Applications-State-of-the-Art.pdf)

The humanity gets increasingly concerned about the environmental footprint it leaves on the Earth. Conventional methods of energy generation as fossil fuels are not alone under attention including all types of batteries. This impulses a rapid development of methods for energy extraction from alternative sources. Energy harvesting is a nonstop growing field of research which aims to provide energy for low-power applications with specific power requirements. This paper makes an overview of these technologies and provides current state of the art for each
harvesting technology.
